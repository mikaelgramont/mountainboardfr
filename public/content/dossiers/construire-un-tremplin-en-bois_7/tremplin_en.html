<p class=grosnoir>Wood Kicker</p>
<p><b>OK, so it's quite simple. If you want to get better at freestyle, you need 
  to train. The problem is it's quite hard to find (if you're in luck) the right 
  place. It's even harder to dig your own kicker (if you're even more in luck, 
  park rangers won't destroy it. It has happened to several of us, including me). 
  A wooden ramp is the solution. You can take it to a good, steep, grass field, 
  and there you go ! Still, you have to build it. But you're reading mountainboard.fr's 
  ramp HowTo, and you get every step described !!</b></p>
<p>Here's what you get: a ramp that fits in a small car (in Europe, we have small 
  cars), if you dis-assemble it.It's in two parts. The first one is two feet high 
  and it is good to start with. With the second part you get a 3 foot high ramp. 
  You can assemble it and disassemble it as many times as you want (no wearing), 
  it's round and mountainboard-sized. Skatepark ramps often are too short. The 
  nose'll get out of the ramp before the tail gets in. You won't have that problem 
  here.</p>
<p><b>Principle:</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Two plywood sheets will be the side of the ramp. About 15 ribs will link 
    them and provide the structure. Thin plywood sheets will come on top and be 
    bended so you get a round shape. Sounds simple ? It is.</p>
  <p>To make sure it won't move, you can use camping tent hooks (no rope required 
    since they will attach directly onto screws).</p>

  <p>Eight 8' 2&quot; by 2&quot;s. You'll cut these into 28&quot; ones.</p>
  <p>One narrower 8'</p>

<p>Hardware</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>A dozen small (2&quot;) nails (or close to that)</p>
  <p>About twenty assembly screw/washer/nuts (3&quot; long, about 6mm large)</p>
  <p>About twenty assembly screw/washer/nuts (5&quot; long, about 6mm large)</p>
  <p>About 30 &quot;double-screws&quot; (as shown below). These may be hard to 
    find. Look for them in DIY shops with screws and nails, though.</p>

  <p>One of the sides (the larger one) will screw into wood, and the other will 
    receive a nut. Thanks to this little baby, we can assemble and dis-assemble 
    the ramp.</p>

<p>Tools</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>A saw, jigsaw, drill, hammer, une lime pour les finitions, a wood pen, a 
    10' long string , chalk, some rubber carpet to put at the bottom of the ramp 
    (I use car carpet turned upside down).</p>

<p>That's all you need (along with your hands and a lot of time)</p>
