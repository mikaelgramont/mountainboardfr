<p><b>Preliminaries </b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Let's start by givig a name to the wood sheets for future reference. The 
    57" one will be called A. The two 4's will be called B(I) & B(II). The three 
    thin ones wil be called 1,2 and 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b>Making the sides</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Draw a line along A's diagonal. Cut along the line with the jigsaw (if all 
    you have is a hand saw, it'll be long and hard to do). You obtain two pieces 
    that will form the sides of the ramp. Name them A(I) & A(II), then overlay 
    them so you can see only one piece. With a couple of nails, make sure they 
    won't move. Do the same for the B sheets (overlay them, and attach them together).</p>
  <p> Line up the A and B groups as shown <a href="images/position1.gif" target="_blank">here</a>. 
    You now need to draw a horizontal line over the B group forming an extension 
    of the base of the A group . You will then cut along this line.</p>
  <p> We're now going to make the shape of the transition. We're going to draw 
    a circle that goes reaches both corners of the pieces. Line up the A and B 
    group.</p>
  <p> This is the most important step. The transition radius is the key to designing 
    a good ramp. The shorter the radius, the higher the ramp will send you; the 
    wider the radius, the softer the ramp. A 9' radius is for height and an 11' 
    radius will be softer. 10' is good for a start. So I chose to describe this 
    one. From this point, you can choose whatever radius you want.</p>
  <p> Take a 10' string with a nail attached at one end, and a chalk at the other. 
    Find the center of the circle knowing it must reach both corners or the A 
    pieces. Fix the nail on the center, then with the chalk, draw the circle on 
    the upper A and B pieces. Make sure the string is always tense so you get 
    a constant radius. Cut along the marks with a jigsaw. Take your time, and 
    do this well. There you have the transition ! Here is a little <a href="images/position2.gif" target="_blank">sketch</a> 
    to help you visualize. You'll see that there's quite lot of unneeded wood 
    on the B pieces, but if you pick a short radius, you'll ditch less wood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b>Ribs</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Let's see the cutting of ribs. You shoul cut them around 28" long. There 
    will be more than enough room for your board, but again you can choose to 
    make it wider. Just make sure you pick a stronger wood for the ribs, and wider 
    sheets to go on top of them. You need to cut 15 of them, plus one made out 
    of the narrower 8'. This one will go at the entry of the ramp wher you need 
    support but don't have room for a wide rib.</p>
  <p> Next drill a hole on each side of the rib, right at the center, at a depth 
    of about 3" (in fact, that's the length Make sure you drill a hole small enough 
    for the double screw to be tightly screwed in. Then, screw one at each end 
    of the rib.</p>
  <p> We now need to decide where the ribs will go precisely. Those that will 
    support pieces 1, 2 & 3 need to be at the edge of the sides of the ramp. You'll 
    have to drill holes that will receive the second end of the "double screw", 
    so now, you need make marks at a certain distance of the upper edge of the 
    A pieces. Make those marks at half the width of the ribs (if you rib is 2" 
    wide, make a mark at 1" of the edge). This <a href="images/position3.gif" target="_blank">sketch</a> 
    will show you where the marks should go. You can see that two of the marks 
    are quite close to one another. In fact, they each will hold a different sheet. 
    Drill the holes.</p>
  <p> You can now assemble everything. You should attach all of the ribs to one 
    of the side of the ramp, tighten the bolts, then flip the ramp on its side. 
    Lay the second side on top of that, and adjust the ribs so they enter the 
    holes. Tighten the bolts on this side, too. Do all these steps on the A and 
    B parts (B is the extension). </p>
