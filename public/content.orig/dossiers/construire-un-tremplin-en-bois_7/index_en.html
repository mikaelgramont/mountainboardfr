<p class=grosnoir>Wood Kicker</p>
<p><b>OK, so it's rather simple. If you want to get better at freestyle, you need 
  to practice. The problem is it's quite hard to find (if you're in luck) the right 
  place to do that. It's even harder to dig your own kicker (if you're even more in luck, 
  park rangers won't destroy it. It has happened to several of us, including me). 
  A wooden ramp is the solution. You can take it to a good, steep, grass field, 
  and there you go ! Still, you have to build it. But you're reading mountainboard.fr's 
  Ramp-HowTo, and you get every step described !!</b></p>
<p>Here's what you get: a ramp that fits in a small car (in Europe, we have small 
  cars), if you dis-assemble it.It's in two parts. The first one is two feet high 
  and it is good to start with. With the second part you get a 3 foot high ramp. 
  You can assemble it and disassemble it as many times as you want (no wearing), 
  it's round and mountainboard-sized. Skatepark ramps often are too short. The 
  nose'll get out of the ramp before the tail gets in. You won't have that problem 
  here.</p>
<p><b>Principle:</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Two plywood sheets will be the side of the ramp. About 15 ribs will link 
    them and provide the structure. Thin plywood sheets will come on top and be 
    bended so you get a round shape. Sounds simple ? It is.</p>
  <p>To make sure it won't move, you can use camping tent hooks (no rope required 
    since they will attach directly onto screws).</p>

<p>That's all you need (along with your hands and a lot of time)</p>

<tr><td>
<p><b>Preliminaries </b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Let's start by givig a name to the wood sheets for future reference. The 
    57" one will be called A. The two 4's will be called B(I) & B(II). The three 
    thin ones wil be called 1,2 and 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b>Making the sides</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Draw a line along A's diagonal. Cut along the line with the jigsaw (if all 
    you have is a hand saw, it'll be long and hard to do). You obtain two pieces 
    that will form the sides of the ramp. Name them A(I) & A(II), then overlay 
    them so you can see only one piece. With a couple of nails, make sure they 
    won't move. Do the same for the B sheets (overlay them, and attach them together).</p>
  <p> Line up the A and B groups as shown <a href="contenu/dossiers/7/position1.gif" target="_blank">here</a>. 
    You now need to draw a horizontal line over the B group forming an extension 
    of the base of the A group . You will then cut along this line.</p>
  <p> We're now going to make the shape of the transition. We're going to draw 
    a circle that goes reaches both corners of the pieces. Line up the A and B 
    group.</p>
  <p> This is the most important step. The transition radius is the key to designing 
    a good ramp. The shorter the radius, the higher the ramp will send you; the 
    wider the radius, the softer the ramp. A 9' radius is for height and an 11' 
    radius will be softer. 10' is good for a start. So I chose to describe this 
    one. From this point, you can choose whatever radius you want.</p>
  <p> Take a 10' string with a nail attached at one end, and a chalk at the other. 
    Find the center of the circle knowing it must reach both corners or the A 
    pieces. Fix the nail on the center, then with the chalk, draw the circle on 
    the upper A and B pieces. Make sure the string is always tense so you get 
    a constant radius. Cut along the marks with a jigsaw. Take your time, and 
    do this well. There you have the transition ! Here is a little <a href="contenu/dossiers/7/position2.gif" target="_blank">sketch</a> 
    to help you visualize. You'll see that there's quite lot of unneeded wood 
    on the B pieces, but if you pick a short radius, you'll ditch less wood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b>Ribs</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Let's see the cutting of ribs. You shoul cut them around 28" long. There 
    will be more than enough room for your board, but again you can choose to 
    make it wider. Just make sure you pick a stronger wood for the ribs, and wider 
    sheets to go on top of them. You need to cut 15 of them, plus one made out 
    of the narrower 8'. This one will go at the entry of the ramp wher you need 
    support but don't have room for a wide rib.</p>
  <p> Next drill a hole on each side of the rib, right at the center, at a depth 
    of about 3" (in fact, that's the length Make sure you drill a hole small enough 
    for the double screw to be tightly screwed in. Then, screw one at each end 
    of the rib.</p>
  <p> We now need to decide where the ribs will go precisely. Those that will 
    support pieces 1, 2 & 3 need to be at the edge of the sides of the ramp. You'll 
    have to drill holes that will receive the second end of the "double screw", 
    so now, you need make marks at a certain distance of the upper edge of the 
    A pieces. Make those marks at half the width of the ribs (if you rib is 2" 
    wide, make a mark at 1" of the edge). This <a href="contenu/dossiers/7/position3.gif" target="_blank">sketch</a> 
    will show you where the marks should go. You can see that two of the marks 
    are quite close to one another. In fact, they each will hold a different sheet. 
    Drill the holes.</p>
  <p> You can now assemble everything. You should attach all of the ribs to one 
    of the side of the ramp, tighten the bolts, then flip the ramp on its side. 
    Lay the second side on top of that, and adjust the ribs so they enter the 
    holes. Tighten the bolts on this side, too. Do all these steps on the A and 
    B parts (B is the extension). </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>First results</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It now should look like <a href="contenu/dossiers/7/structure.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Top sheets</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  We now have to attach the top sheets (1,2 & 3) to the structure. Lay them 
    over the structure, starting from the bottom. Make sure the sheets 1 & 2 each 
    lay upon one of the ribs we talked about (the ones that are close).
  Make marks where the sheets are too long, and cut them. Put them back on 
    the structure, and nail them (temporarily, you want to be able to take the 
    nails off). You're going to drill through the top sheets and the ribs that 
    support them. You'll later put screws in the holes for rigidity and to be 
    able to bend the top sheets. In order to do that, you need to check where 
    the ribs are, and make marks on the top sheets, above the ribs. Put these 
    marks at about 8" from the side edges. You <b>need</b> to put screws at about 
    half of the top sheets length. This will allow a good, even, bending of the 
    sheets. Drill the holes a bit wider than the screws you'll use, so it's easy 
    to put them in. Once you've done this, you can put the screws in. The longer 
    ones go in the middle, so it's easy to bend the top sheets (you'll understand 
    when you're done).
  </blockquote>
<p><b>The extension</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  With what you have left from the 8's, cut 4 2's. Drill four holes in them. 
    Disassemble the ramp, and get the pieces A(I) and A(II) , and B(I) and B(II) 
    together. Line them up like in the second sketch. Lay two of the 2' ribs like 
    <a href="contenu/dossiers/7/position4.gif" target="_blank">this</a>. Drill two holes in 
    A and two holes in B, through the 2' ribs. Put screws in the holes, and tighten 
    them. Again, the holes need to be a bit wider than the screw for easy assembling.
  <br>You can assemble everything back.
</blockquote>
<p><b>Final touch</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Fix the carpet at the entry of the ramp, so you don't spoil the wood when 
    you ride on it. Clean the holes and edges so you don't get wood under your 
    skin every time you touch the ramp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>A couple of advices</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>the ramp will easily support the weight of a rider in normal conditions. 
    Still, if someone crashes on it, it may break (happened to me - see the "ramp 
    breaker" video). You may want to use thicker wood to add strength. I have 
    used the ramp exactly as it is described here. But you may want to use 3 or 
    4 more ribs for extra-solidity.</p>
  <p>You may want to paint the ramp with an all weather paint so it's more weather 
    proof</p>
  <p>Also, if you don't need to disassemble the ramp, you can use normal screws 
    instaed of "double-screws". </p>
  <p>Last, if you can come up with a way to use MTB wheels to carry the ramp around, 
    please let me know, as I haven't found one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Use</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> With a 10' radius, it takes a fair amount of speed to get any high. Think 
    about getting camping tent hooks to fix the ramp to the ground if you're going 
    to use it on steep terrain. That's it !</p>
