<p><b>Top sheets</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>We now have to attach the top sheets (1,2 & 3) to the structure. Lay them 
    over the structure, starting from the bottom. Make sure the sheets 1 & 2 each 
    lay upon one of the ribs we talked about (the ones that are close).</p>
  <p>Make marks where the sheets are too long, and cut them. Put them back on 
    the structure, and nail them (temporarily, you want to be able to take the 
    nails off). You're going to drill through the top sheets and the ribs that 
    support them. You'll later put screws in the holes for rigidity and to be 
    able to bend the top sheets. In order to do that, you need to check where 
    the ribs are, and make marks on the top sheets, above the ribs. Put these 
    marks at about 8" from the side edges. You <b>need</b> to put screws at about 
    half of the top sheets length. This will allow a good, even, bending of the 
    sheets. Drill the holes a bit wider than the screws you'll use, so it's easy 
    to put them in. Once you've done this, you can put the screws in. The longer 
    ones go in the middle, so it's easy to bend the top sheets (you'll understand 
    when you're done).</p>
  </blockquote>
<p><b>The extension</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>With what you have left from the 8's, cut 4 2's. Drill four holes in them. 
    Disassemble the ramp, and get the pieces A(I) and A(II) , and B(I) and B(II) 
    together. Line them up like in the second sketch. Lay two of the 2' ribs like 
    <a href="images/position4.gif" target="_blank">this</a>. Drill two holes in 
    A and two holes in B, through the 2' ribs. Put screws in the holes, and tighten 
    them. Again, the holes need to be a bit wider than the screw for easy assembling.</p>
  <p>You can assemble everything back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Final touch</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Fix the carpet at the entry of the ramp, so you don't spoil the wood when 
    you ride on it. Clean the holes and edges so you don't get wood under your 
    skin every time you touch the ramp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>A couple of advices</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>the ramp will easily support the weight of a rider in normal conditions. 
    Still, if someone crashes on it, it may break (happened to me - see the "ramp 
    breaker" video). You may want to use thicker wood to add strength. I have 
    used the ramp exactly as it is described here. But you may want to use 3 or 
    4 more ribs for extra-solidity.</p>
  <p>You may want to paint the ramp with an all weather paint so it's more weather 
    proof</p>
  <p>Also, if you don't need to disassemble the ramp, you can use normal screws 
    instaed of "double-screws". </p>
  <p>Last, if you can come up with a way to use MTB wheels to carry the ramp around, 
    please let me know, as I haven't found one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Use</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> With a 10' radius, it takes a fair amount of speed to get any high. Think 
    about getting camping tent hooks to fix the ramp to the ground if you're going 
    to use it on steep terrain. That's it !</p>
